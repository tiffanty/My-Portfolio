Hi, my name is Tiffany!

I'm an Economics major with a minor in Elements of Computing at the University of Texas at Austin. Passionate about software development, I enjoy exploring different programming paradigms and building projects that enhance my technical skills.

My repositories showcase my proficiency in Javascript, React, Typescript, Python and more!
